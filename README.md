# Projects highlights

## [![stability-wip](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-wip-lightgrey.svg)](https://github.com/mkenney/software-guides/blob/master/STABILITY-BADGES.md#work-in-progress) Engineering thesis - Android sports tracker 
For my thesis, I'm making Android sport tracking app.
Compared to most of tracking apps on the market it won't require to log in or give personal info to the vendor.
After I'm done with thesis this project will be open-source'd.
